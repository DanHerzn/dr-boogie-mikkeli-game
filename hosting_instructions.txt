5. Get a public URL like: https://your-game-name.up.railway.app

#### Option B: Render (Free)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to render.com
3. Create new Web Service
4. Connect GitHub repo
5. Use these settings:
   - Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure Firebase for database

### 3. Custom Domain (Optional)
After deploying to any service above:
1. Buy a domain (e.g., namecheap.com, godaddy.com)
2. Point it to your hosting service
3. Update QR code with your custom domain

## Updating QR Code
1. Deploy your game to chosen hosting service
2. Get the public URL
3. Run this script with your URL:
   python qr_generator.py --url "https://your-actual-url.com"

## Mobile Access Tips
- Make sure mobile devices can access the URL
- Test on different devices and browsers
- For local network: ensure all devices are on same WiFi
- For cloud hosting: URL works anywhere with internet

## Security Notes
- The included SQLite database is for development
- For production, consider PostgreSQL
- Set proper environment variables
- Enable HTTPS for production

## Troubleshooting
- If QR code doesn't work: verify URL is accessible
- If mobile issues: check responsive design
- If database issues: check file permissions
- If deployment fails: check logs in hosting service

Good luck with your game deployment! ðŸŽ®
